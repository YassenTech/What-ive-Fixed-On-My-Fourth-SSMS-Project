🗄️ Shopping Trends Data Cleaning Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and improving a shopping trends dataset to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability. The main objective was to identify and fix common data entry mistakes made by customers and prepare the dataset for accurate analysis and future expansion.

I’m a 14-year-old developer passionate about technology, databases, and continuous self-improvement. This project represents my commitment to building strong technical foundations early and understanding the importance of clean, structured data in real-world systems.

🛠️ Problems Identified & Fixed
✅ Location Field Issues
Some location entries contained unnecessary spaces and inconsistent formatting. These issues could cause incorrect filtering and grouping results. I standardized the data to ensure consistency and reliability.

✅ Gender Formatting Inconsistencie
Formatting inconsistencies in the gender column could lead to inaccurate reporting. I normalized the entries to ensure clean and structured data.

✅ Size Data Cleanup
Product size values had inconsistencies that could affect analytics and filtering. I cleaned and standardized these values to improve data integrity.

🎯 Why This Matters

Data accuracy is critical in any database system. Even small inconsistencies can cause reporting errors and unreliable insights. After cleaning the dataset:
Data consistency is improved
Filtering and grouping now work correctly
The dataset is analysis-ready
The database structure is stronger
Future relational operations will be more reliable
This project strengthened my understanding of professional database practices and data integrity.

🚀 What’s Next

In my next update (in 2 days), I will implement JOIN operations to connect multiple tables and create more advanced relational queries.
By the time I graduate in 7 months, I will have knowledge in:

Network Fundamentals
CompTIA A+
CCNA
6 Programming Languages
React
Dart
I am committed to consistent learning, structured practice, and building real projects to support these skills.
